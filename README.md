Blog built with Spark

The main (index) page lists blog entry titles with a title and date/time created. Each blog entry title links to a detail page that displays the blog entry title, date, body, and comments, along with a comment form that allows anonymous users to blogPost comments. The edit page is password-protected and gives the ability for an admin to add or edit blog entries.
